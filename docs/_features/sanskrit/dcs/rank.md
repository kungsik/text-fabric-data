**rank**

The rank of a word occurrence, a measure related to its frequency.

This feature is present on objects of type [*word*](otype).

The rank of an item is the number of items that have a higher frequency.
So items with rank 0 have the highest frequency.
If two or more items have identical frequency, they have the same rank, but the rank immediately below is not one lower, but *n* lower,
where *n* is the amount of items with that same frequency.
