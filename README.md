Text-Fabric data is a collection of richly annotated data sources.
They are stored here in a compact, plain text format
[.tf](https://github.com/ETCBC/text-fabric/wiki/File-formats).

The available texts include the Hebrew Bible and the Greek New Testament, both 
annotated with morphology and grammar.
Multiple people and organizations have contributed to these datasets.
There is extensive documentation about the conditions of use, provenance and structure of these datasets.

These text materials are complex fabrics of text representations and (linguistic) annotations.
In order to work with them, you need software such as 
[Text-Fabric](https://github.com/ETCBC/text-fabric/wiki)
which is a Python package that you can easily install.
